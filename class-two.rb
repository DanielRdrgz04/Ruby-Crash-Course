    What is the difference between 'chomp' and 'chop'?
    In most cases, chomp is preferable because it won't remove the final character unless
    it is the record separator which is usually a newline,
    whereas chop will remove the last character no matter what it is.
=end

# Example one
print "Ingrese su nombre: "
nom = gets.chomp
print "Ingrese su apellido: "
ape = gets.chop

puts "Su nombre es " + nom + " y su apellido es " + ape.chop + "!"

    Which are the different variables scopes and what are them used for?
    1. Global scope: variables defined at the top-level
        begin with a dollar sing '$' ($global_var)

    2. Local scope: have a limited scope and are accessible only within a
        specific block, method or module
        begin with a lowercase letter or an underscore (local_var)

    3. Instance scope: class by all methods
        begin with a single symbol '@' (@instance_var)

    4. Class scope: can be accessed by class methods
        begin with two '@' (@@class_var)

    5. Constant Scope
        declared with uppercase_letters (CONSTANT_NAME)

    A string is an object from the String class. What are the methods 'reverse' and 'capitalize', and 'length' for?
    Reverse:
        The reverse method is used to reverse the characters of a string.
        It returns a new string with the characters in reverse order
    Capitalize:
        The capitalize method is used to capitalize the first character of a string while making the remaining characters lowercase.
        It returns a new string with the modified capitalization
    Length:
        The length method is used to determine the number of characters in a string.
        It returns an integer representing the length of the string
=end

# Reverse
string = "Hello, world!"
reversed_string = string.reverse
puts "Reverse String: " + reversed_string

# Capitalize
string2 = "hello, world!"
capitalized_string = string2.capitalize
puts "Capitalized String: " + capitalized_string

# Length
string3 = "Hello, world!"
string_length = string3.length
puts "String Length: " + string_length
